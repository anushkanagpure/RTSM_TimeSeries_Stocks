Analysis: Objective: To analyze the daily returns of ICICI BANK stock
from 2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Analysis: Extracted the adjusted closing
prices of ICICI BANK stock, calculated daily returns, and visualized
them. Result: The 'ICICIBANK.NS' plot displays the daily returns of
ICICI BANK stock over the specified period. Implication: The plot
indicates the volatility and direction of daily returns for ICICI BANK
stock during the given time frame. Observations from the plot can help
investors understand the historical performance and risk associated with
ITC stock.

#ADF test for Stationery

adf_test_jj = adf.test(ICICIBANK.NS_return); adf_test_jj

```

Analysis:

Objective: To conduct an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for
stationarity on the daily returns of ICICI BANK stock. Analysis:
Performed the ADF test using the 'adf.test' function and obtained
results. Result: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on
ICICI BANK daily returns yields the following results: - Dickey-Fuller
statistic: -10.345 - Lag order: 11 - p-value: 0.01 - Alternative
hypothesis: Stationary

Implication: The ADF test suggests that the daily returns of ICICI BANK
stock are likely stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates evidence
against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. Therefore, we have
reason to believe that the ICICI BANK stock returns exhibit
stationarity, which is important for certain time series analyses.

#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds = Box.test(ICICIBANK.NS_return); lb_test_ds
#If autocorrelation exists then autoARIMA

```

Analysis:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the daily
returns of ICICI BANK stock. Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box test
using the 'Box.test' function and obtained results. Result: The
Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on ICICI BANK daily returns yields
the following results: - X-squared statistic: 1.9756 - Degrees of
freedom: 1 - p-value: 0.1599

Implication: The Ljung-Box test indicates significant autocorrelation in
the ICICI BANK stock daily returns. The p-value (0.1599) suggests that
there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no
autocorrelation. In other words, based on this test alone, it appears
that there may not be significant autocorrelation present.

Action: Given that there is no presence of autocorrelation, it may be
advisable to not to consider an autoARIMA model for time series
forecasting.

#ACF and PCF

acf(ICICIBANK.NS_price) # ACF of JJ Series
pacf(ICICIBANK.NS_price) # PACF of JJ Series

#AutoArima
arma_pq_ds = auto.arima(ICICIBANK.NS_return); arma_pq_ds
arma_pq = auto.arima(ICICIBANK.NS_price); arma_pq

```

Note: Although there is no autocorrelation in ICICI BANK returns data;
for academic understanding purpose, I have executed the code. Analysis:

Objective: To perform autoARIMA modeling on the daily returns
('ICICIBANK_return') and adjusted closing prices ('ICICIBANK_price') of
ICICI BANK stock.

Analysis: Used the 'auto.arima' function to automatically select the
ARIMA model for both returns and prices. Results:

For Daily Returns ('ICICIBANK.NS_return'): The autoARIMA model suggests
an ARIMA(3,0,2) with zero mean. Coefficients: - AR: ar1 to ar3 - MA: ma1
to ma2 - sigma\^2 (variance) = 0.0004207 - Log likelihood = 3655.33 -
AIC=-7296.65 AICc=-7296.58 BIC=-7259.56

For Adjusted Closing Prices ('ICICIBANK.NS_price'): The autoARIMA model
suggests an ARIMA(2,1,3) with a non-zero mean. Coefficients: - AR: ar1
to ar2 - MA: ma1 to ma3 - Mean: mean term - sigma\^2 (variance) =
99.47 - Log likelihood = -5500.98 - AIC=11015.97 AICc=11016.04
BIC=11053.06

Implication: The autoARIMA models provide a statistical framework to
capture the underlying patterns in both daily returns and adjusted
closing prices of ICICI BANK stock. These models can be used for
forecasting future values, and the AIC, AICc, and BIC values help in
model comparison.

Note: Interpretation of the coefficients and model selection details may
require further analysis based on the specific context of the financial
data.

#Arima manuplation
arma13 = arima(ICICIBANK.NS_return, order = c(3, 0, 2)); arma13
ds_fpq = forecast(arma13, h = 500)
plot(ds_fpq)
```

Analysis:

Objective: To fit an ARIMA(3,0,2) model to the daily returns
('ICICIBANK.NS_return') of ICICI BANK stock and generate forecasts.
Analysis: Used the 'arima' function to fit the ARIMA model and the
'forecast' function to generate forecasts. Results:

ARIMA Model (3,0,2): Coefficients: - AR: ar1 to ar3 - MA: ma1 to ma2 -
Intercept term - sigma\^2 (variance) = 0.0004207 - Log likelihood =
3655.33 - AIC= -7296.65

Forecasting: Generated forecasts for the next 500 time points using the
fitted ARIMA model.

Plot: The plot displays the original time series of daily returns along
with the forecasted values.

Implication: The ARIMA(3,0,2) model is fitted to the historical daily
returns of ICICI BANK stock, providing insights into the underlying
patterns. The generated forecast can be used for future predictions, and
the plot visually represents the model's performance.

Note: Interpretation of coefficients and model evaluation details may
require further analysis based on the specific context of the financial
data.

#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds_A = Box.test(arma13$residuals); lb_test_ds_A
#After this no autocorrelation exists

```

Analysis:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the
residuals of the ARIMA(3, 0, 2) model. Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box
test using the 'Box.test' function on the residuals of the ARIMA model
and obtained results. Results:

Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation on Residuals: - X-squared statistic:
0.0053322 - Degrees of freedom: 1 - p-value: 0.9418

Implication: The Ljung-Box test indicates no significant autocorrelation
in the residuals of the ARIMA(3, 0, 2) model. The high p-value (0.9418)
suggests that there is no evidence against the null hypothesis of no
autocorrelation.

Action: The absence of autocorrelation in residuals is a positive
outcome, indicating that the ARIMA model adequately captures the
temporal patterns in the time series.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Box Test 
stk_ret_sq = arma13$residuals^2 # Return Variance (Since Mean Returns is approx. 0)
plot(stk_ret_sq)
stk_ret_sq_box_test = Box.test(stk_ret_sq, lag = 11) # H0: Return Variance Series is Not Serially Correlated
stk_ret_sq_box_test # Inference : Return Variance Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
stk_ret_arch_test = ArchTest(arma13$residuals, lags = 11) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

```

Analysis: Objective: To test for volatility clustering or
heteroskedasticity in the residuals of the ARIMA(3, 0, 2) model.
Analysis: Conducted Box test and ARCH test on the squared residuals to
assess the presence of volatility clustering. Results:

1.  Box Test for Volatility Clustering:

-   X-squared statistic: 577.36
-   Degrees of freedom: 11
-   p-value \< 2.2e-16 Inference: The Box test indicates significant
    evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the return
    variance series exhibits volatility clustering or
    heteroskedasticity.

2.  ARCH Test for Volatility Clustering:
    -   Chi-squared statistic: 263.94
    -   Degrees of freedom: 11
    -   p-value: \< 2.2e-16 Inference: The ARCH test also provides
        strong evidence against the null hypothesis, supporting the
        presence of ARCH effects in the return series. This implies that
        the returns have volatility clustering.

Implication: The results from both tests suggest that the residuals of
the ARIMA(3, 0, 2) model exhibit volatility clustering or
heteroskedasticity. Understanding and accounting for this pattern in
volatility is essential for risk management and forecasting.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
gar_resd = residuals(nse_ret_garch2)^2
stk_ret_arch_test1 = ArchTest(gar_resd, lags = 11) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test1 # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)
```

Analysis: Objective: To fit GARCH models to the residuals of the
ARIMA(3, 0, 2) model and test for volatility clustering. Analysis:
Fitted two GARCH models ('garch_model1' and 'garch_model2') to the
residuals and performed an ARCH test on squared residuals. Results:

1.  GARCH Model 1:
    -   sGARCH(1,1) model with ARFIMA(3, 0, 2) mean.
    -   Optimal Parameters:
        -   mu (Mean): -0.000138
        -   omega: 0.000006
        -   alpha1: 0.105242
        -   beta1: 0.883844
    -   Log likelihood: 3898.726
    -   Weighted Ljung-Box Test on Standardized Residuals and Squared
        Residuals show significant autocorrelation.
    -   Weighted ARCH LM Tests indicate evidence of ARCH effects.
2.  GARCH Model 2:
    -   sGARCH(1,1) model with ARFIMA(3, 0, 2) mean.
    -   Optimal Parameters are similar to Model 1.
    -   Log likelihood: 3898.726
    -   Weighted Ljung-Box Test and Weighted ARCH LM Tests show evidence
        of autocorrelation and ARCH effects.

ARCH Test on Squared Residuals: - Lag[1] statistic: 0.3622 -
Lag[2\*(p+q)+(p+q)-1][5] statistic: 5.4368 - Lag[4\*(p+q)+(p+q)-1][9]
statistic: 8.8613 - p-value: 3.246e-12 Inference: The ARCH test confirms
the presence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the
residuals.

Implication: Both GARCH models suggest that the residuals exhibit
volatility clustering. The ARCH test further supports the presence of
heteroskedasticity in the squared residuals.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}

garch_modelf = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(3,2), include.mean = FALSE))
stk_ret_garch = ugarchfit(garch_modelf, data = ICICIBANK.NS_return); stk_ret_garch
```

Analysis:

Objective: To fit a GARCH model to the daily returns of ICICI BANK stock
and assess the goodness-of-fit using the Adjusted Pearson
Goodness-of-Fit Test. Analysis: Used the 'ugarchspec' and 'ugarchfit'
functions to fit a GARCH model and performed the Adjusted Pearson
Goodness-of-Fit Test. Results:

GARCH Model: - sGARCH(1,1) model with ARFIMA(3,0,2) mean. - Optimal
Parameters are not provided in the output.

Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test: - The test was performed for
different group sizes (20, 30, 40, and 50). - For each group size, the
test statistic and p-value were calculated. - All p-values are extremely
low, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of a good
fit.

Implication: The Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test suggests that the
fitted GARCH model may not provide a good fit to the observed daily
returns of ITC stock. The low p-values indicate a significant
discrepancy between the model and the observed data.

Note: Interpretation may vary based on the specific context of the
financial data and the assumptions underlying the time series analysis.

```{r}
# GARCH Forecast
stk_ret_garch_forecast1 = ugarchforecast(stk_ret_garch, n.ahead = 50); stk_ret_garch_forecast1
```

Objective: To forecast volatility using the fitted GARCH model for the
next 50 time points. Analysis: Used the 'ugarchforecast' function to
generate volatility forecasts for the next 50 time points. Results:

GARCH Model Forecast: - Model: sGARCH - Horizon: 50 - Roll Steps: 0 -
Out of Sample: 0

0-roll forecast [T0=2022-03-02]: - Forecasted Series: - T+1 to T+50:
Contains forecasted values of volatility (Sigma) for each time point.

Implication: The forecasted values represent the predicted volatility
for the next 50 time points based on the fitted GARCH model. These
forecasts can be useful for risk management and decision-making,
providing insights into the expected future volatility of the financial
time series.
